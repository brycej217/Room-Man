# Room Man
Room Man is a game where the enemies come to you! Fight off wave after wave of enemy, get better guns and upgrades, but watch out! The more powerful you become, the more easily you can destroy your own room, and when the room breaks down, the enemies can get inside even quicker!  
Room Man is currently under development for UPenn's [UPGRADE Club](https://pennupgrade.com/), and will be featured in their semesterly PennBoy. Stay tuned for updates but for now enjoy these development screenshots:
